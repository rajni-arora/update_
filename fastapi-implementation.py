“In this sprint, I created and deployed a FastAPI service on Dihydra. The service fetches input files from an S3 bucket, processes them, and stores the output back to S3. I modified the deployment script to suit the new service and integrated everything smoothly. We also enhanced the output metadata — previously it had 6 fields, now it includes 8. The code has been moved from my personal GitHub to the main MXLumos repo, and everything is ready for use.”
