I understand there's confusion about the filename format. Let me clarify the situation and provide a more specific solution.

If you're getting "timestamp_filename" but you want "filename_timestamp", we need to modify how the files are being renamed during the S3 move operation.

Let's assume your `move_objects` function is copying files from one S3 location to another. The issue seems to be with how the destination filenames are constructed.

Old lines (assuming this is how it's currently implemented):
```python
#Archive meta
s3_archive_folder_meta = config['s3_file_paths']['archive_data_path_meta']
s3.move_objects(input_path_meta, s3_archive_folder_meta)
```

New lines with a custom implementation to control the filename format:
```python
# Generate timestamp for archiving
from datetime import datetime
timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Helper function to rename files with timestamp at the end
def move_with_timestamp(source_path, dest_folder, timestamp):
    # List objects in the source path
    objects = s3.list_objects(source_path)
    
    for obj in objects:
        # Get the original filename
        filename = obj.split('/')[-1]
        # Split filename and extension
        name, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
        # Create new filename with timestamp at the end
        new_filename = f"{name}_{timestamp}{ext}"
        # Construct full destination path
        dest_path = f"{dest_folder}/{new_filename}"
        # Copy object to new location with new name
        s3.copy_object(obj, dest_path)
        # Delete original object
        s3.delete_object(obj)

#Archive meta
s3_archive_folder_meta = config['s3_file_paths']['archive_data_path_meta']
move_with_timestamp(input_path_meta, s3_archive_folder_meta, timestamp)

#Archive values
s3_archive_folder_values = config['s3_file_paths']['archive_data_path_values']
move_with_timestamp(input_path_values, s3_archive_folder_values, timestamp)

#Archive Knowledge
s3_archive_folder_knowledge = config['s3_file_paths']['archive_data_path_Knowledge']
move_with_timestamp(s3_knowledge_path, s3_archive_folder_knowledge, timestamp)

#Archive Others/miscellineous
s3_archive_folder_few_shot = config['s3_file_paths']['archive_data_path_Others']
move_with_timestamp(input_path_few_shot, s3_archive_folder_few_shot, timestamp)
```

This custom `move_with_timestamp` function:
1. Lists all objects in the source path
2. For each object, extracts the filename and extension
3. Creates a new filename with the timestamp appended before the extension
4. Copies the object to the destination with the new filename
5. Deletes the original object

This ensures your files will be named as "filename_timestamp.extension" rather than "timestamp_filename.extension".

If you need more specific help with the existing `move_objects` function, please share its implementation and I can provide a more tailored solution.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
