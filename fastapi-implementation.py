	‚Ä¢	Consider roles, offices, committees, policies, standards, programs, definitions, frameworks, and processes all as entities.

üëâ This prompt ensures you don‚Äôt miss any community/entity and lays the groundwork for later converting them into triplets for your knowledge graph.

Would you like me to now turn this into a JSON schema-based extraction prompt (so that the model outputs directly in JSON format for easier parsing in your Python pipeline)?
