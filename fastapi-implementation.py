The EA Playbook has been finalized after a thorough review by the CDO. Their feedback, mainly around the Technical Architecture Component Diagram, was addressed via GitHub issues. All suggested changes have been implemented and reviewed. The playbook has now been moved from my personal GitHub repository to the main MXLumos repository for official use. You can refer to the finalized EA Playbook here: [insert link]. This documentation is now ready to be used as a reference for the project.
