## Theoretical Flow Explanation

### **Current State (Your Original Code):**
- **Input**: API call triggers download of ALL files from S3 directories
- **Process**: Downloads entire directories (meta, values, few_shot, knowledge_base)
- **Output**: Processes all files at once, then archives everything

### **Modified Approach (What I Proposed):**

## **Forward Flow:**

### **Step 1: API Request**
- **Input**: API call with specific filename and file_type
- **Action**: Instead of "process everything", now it's "process this specific file"

### **Step 2: Validation Check**
- **Input**: Filename from API request
- **Action**: Check two things:
  1. Does this file exist in S3? (HEAD request to S3)
  2. Has this file been processed before? (Check local processed_files.json)
- **Decision Point**: If file doesn't exist OR already processed → throw error and stop

### **Step 3: Single File Download**
- **Input**: Validated filename
- **Action**: Download ONLY that specific file from S3 to local directory
- **Output**: One file in local storage instead of entire directory

### **Step 4: Processing**
- **Input**: Single downloaded file
- **Action**: Run your existing preprocessing_main() function
- **Output**: Processed/indexed data

### **Step 5: Tracking & Archiving**
- **Input**: Successfully processed file
- **Action**: 
  1. Add filename to processed_files.json (so we don't process it again)
  2. Move file from S3 active folder to archive folder (your existing logic)
- **Output**: File marked as "done" and archived

## **What Changes in Information Flow:**

### **Before (Batch Processing):**
```
API Call → Download ALL → Process ALL → Archive ALL → Done
```

### **After (Single File Processing):**
```
API Call (with filename) → Check if valid → Download ONE → Process ONE → Archive ONE → Done
```

## **Backward Flow (Error Handling):**

### **If File Not Found in S3:**
- **Trigger**: S3 HEAD request fails
- **Response**: HTTP 404 error "File not found in S3"
- **Action**: Stop processing, don't download anything

### **If File Already Processed:**
- **Trigger**: Filename exists in processed_files.json
- **Response**: HTTP 400 error "File already processed"
- **Action**: Stop processing, prevent reprocessing

### **If Processing Fails:**
- **Trigger**: preprocessing_main() throws exception
- **Response**: HTTP 500 error with details
- **Action**: File stays in active folder (not archived), can be retried

## **Key Theoretical Benefits:**

1. **Granular Control**: Process files one by one instead of bulk
2. **Error Isolation**: If one file fails, others aren't affected
3. **Restart Capability**: Can resume from where you left off
4. **Resource Management**: Lower memory usage (one file vs entire directory)
5. **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't reprocess same file twice

## **Input/Output Summary:**

**Input**: 
- Filename (string)
- File type (meta/values/few_shot)

**Output**: 
- Success: "File processed and archived"
- Error: Specific error message (not found/already processed/processing failed)

**State Change**: 
- File moves from "S3 active folder" → "Local processing" → "S3 archive folder"
- Filename gets added to "processed files list"

The core concept is changing from "batch processing everything at once" to "controlled single-file processing with state tracking."​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
