✅ Key User Stories & Accomplishments
	1.	Integration of Indexing Pipeline into Pre-Processing
	•	Refactored the existing pre-processing pipeline to seamlessly invoke the indexing pipeline as a downstream step.
	•	Ensures that new or updated data is not only cleaned and transformed but also automatically pushed for indexing, streamlining end-to-end data flow.
	2.	Payload Format & Schema Update
	•	Updated the payload structure to match new requirements, including changes to the expected schema.
	•	Modified embedding generation logic and its structure to better support enhanced search relevance and model compatibility.
	3.	Sensitive Data Handling – Redaction & Encryption
	•	Applied robust redaction and encryption logic to sensitive fields in the pre-processing stage.
	•	Ensured compliance with data privacy standards and improved trust in data handling within the pipeline.
	4.	Testing & Deployment on Hydra
	•	Conducted comprehensive unit and integration testing for the revised pre-processing logic.
	•	Successfully deployed the pipeline onto Hydra, ensuring it runs reliably in production with monitoring hooks.
	5.	Data Upload to Data Stacks
	•	Uploaded newly prepared and processed data into Data Stacks, making it available for downstream analytics and search pipelines.
	•	Verified schema consistency and ingestion success post-upload.
